            <h4 class="title">Our Policy</h4>
            <li>Customers requested order changes can be made up to 3 days. After this date, customers are not allowed to change or drop the order.</li>
            
            <li>Since some products will have different price at different time or in different days because of bid or bargaining, only the price displayed on that date or at that particular date is the valid price. Customers need to pay attention to any statement about the price. After users made an order, the system does not allow buyers to change price anymore.</li>
            
            <li>The real product may not be with seller’s description sometimes and the policy accept the request to return the product if customers are not satisfied. However, customers can only apply for returning back the goods within 7 days. After that date, there is nothing we can do.</li>
            
            <li>Although our system will not be responsible for the delivery process but we friendly remind all customers that the delivery quality can differ from different orders.</li>

            <li>Once a customer posts a listing, it is a legal responsibility to sell the item at bid’s closing price and to deliver it in the condition advertised to bidders. Any other auction is not allowed. Withdrawing items is not allowed either. Sellers are also not allowed to bid on their own auctions.
           The price must not be changed after the order is placed. </li>
<li>When replying to members’ request, sellers are only allowed to reply as the format of URL.</li>
<li>Sellers can only start working on the review section after the trade is successfully finished which means after the buyers confirm that they have received the item.</li>
<li>The system does not allow users to change any rating data in the review session after they finishing reviewing.
</li>
            <li>Winning bidders dropping the items after the deal ends is strongly discouraged. The system will not allow you to do that. When people do that, the system will not accept the application of deleting the order only if the seller would like to get in touch with supervisors and meet the agreement.</li>
<li>Buyers can only track trade record after the order is placed.</li>
<li>Buyers can only start working on the review section after the trade is successfully finished which means after the buyers confirm that they have received the item.</li>
<li>The system does not allow users to change any rating data in the review session after they finishing reviewing.
